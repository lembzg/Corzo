Cash Out Network
Strategic Partnership Infrastructure
Our Partner 1: The largest pharmacy network in Latin America, providing cash-out infrastructure across the region.
9,500+ Locations across Mexico, Chile, and Colombia.
Accessible locations in urban and rural areas

Why this partnership works
Trusted brand with 25+ years in operation
High foot traffic and accessibility
Proven cash handling infrastructure
Extended operating hours (many 24/7)

Our Partner 2: Operates a few thousand stores across Latin America and a few hundred in the U.S. 25,987 OXXO stores in its Proximity Americas division (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and the U.S.). Of these, 23,206 are in Mexico as of end-2024, implying roughly 2,800–2,900 stores across the rest of the Americas.

Why this partnership works
Massive daily-use footprint
Stores are embedded in everyday routines—high-frequency, convenience-driven traffic that’s hard to replicate through digital or traditional retail alone.
Proven operating model beyond Mexico
With thousands of stores already operating successfully across multiple Latin American markets and the U.S., OXXO has shown it can localize, scale, and execute consistently.
Physical reach + last-mile relevance
The network enables fast, low-friction access to consumers where they already are—especially valuable for payments, pickups, services, and omnichannel strategies.
Trusted brand at neighborhood level
Isn’t just big; it’s familiar. That trust lowers adoption barriers for new services introduced through the partnership.
Room to grow internationally - While Mexico remains the core, the ~3,000 stores outside Mexico represent a meaningful and expanding platform for regional growth without starting from zero.

Problem Statement
Social and Economic Implications
4% of GDP is remittance, on essential areas such as food, health care, education, housing

Slow Processing Time
2 - 5 days for bank transfers, while faster transfers incur high fees

Unfavourable Fees
5 - 9% fees, leaving much lesser for remittance recipients

The Solution & How does it work




Scale - Why this matters economically?
 • Mexico receives $66B in remittances every year
 • $53B (80%) flows through the U.S. → Mexico corridor
 • That makes Mexico the #2 remittance recipient globally and #1 in Latin America
 • Even a 1% improvement in how this money moves represents a
 • $1.76B opportunity—while directly improving lives like Sara’s.
